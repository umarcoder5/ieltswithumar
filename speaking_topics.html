            <h4>Part 1: Hometown</h4>
            <p>
                <b>1. Where is your hometown?</b><br>
                - My hometown is located in a rural area, about two hours from the capital city.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>2. What do you like most about your hometown?</b><br>
                - I love the peaceful atmosphere and the strong sense of community. Everyone knows everyone, and people are always willing to help each other out.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>3. Is there anything you don't like about it?</b><br>
                - The main thing I don't like is the lack of public transport. It's difficult to get around without a car, and there aren't many opportunities for young people.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>4. Has your hometown changed much since you were a child?</b><br>
                - Not drastically, but it has changed a bit. Some of the small family-run shops have closed and been replaced by chain stores. There's also more traffic on the roads now.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>5. Would you prefer to live in a city or a small town?</b><br>
                - I think I prefer a city. While I appreciate the quiet of a small town, I like the excitement, the variety of things to do, and the career opportunities that a city offers.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h4>Part 2: A Place You'd Like to Visit</h4>
            <p>
                <b>Describe a place in your country that you would like to visit.</b><br>
                - I'd love to visit the ancient city of Kyoto. It's famous for its beautiful temples, traditional wooden houses, and stunning gardens. I'm fascinated by the historical and cultural aspects of the city. I would spend my time visiting the famous temples, like Kinkaku-ji and Fushimi Inari-taisha, and maybe even try to take part in a traditional tea ceremony. I'd also love to walk through the Arashiyama Bamboo Grove. I have a deep interest in Japanese history and culture, and Kyoto is considered the cultural heart of the country. I've seen so many beautiful pictures and documentaries about it, and I feel like experiencing it in person would be an amazing and enriching experience. I think visiting it would give me a better understanding of my country's rich heritage.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h4>Part 3: Tourism</h4>
            <p>
                <b>1. What are the benefits of tourism for a country?</b><br>
                - Tourism brings significant economic benefits. It creates jobs, boosts local businesses, and generates revenue for the government through taxes. It also promotes cultural exchange and helps preserve historical sites and traditions.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>2. What are some of the disadvantages of having a lot of tourists?</b><br>
                - Heavy tourism can lead to over-crowding and damage to historical sites. It can also cause an increase in the cost of living for local residents and sometimes leads to the commercialization of local cultures, turning them into a performance for tourists.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>3. Do you think it's important for people to travel to other countries?</b><br>
                - Yes, I think it's very important. Traveling to other countries broadens our perspective. It helps us understand different cultures, challenges our assumptions, and gives us a better appreciation of the world. It's a very educational experience.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>4. How has technology changed the way people plan their holidays?</b><br>
                - Technology has made holiday planning much easier. People can now book flights and accommodation online, read reviews from other travelers, and use apps to navigate new places. This has given people more control and flexibility over their travel plans.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>5. What can a government do to encourage more tourists to visit a country?</b><br>
                - Governments can invest in infrastructure, such as airports and roads. They can also promote the country internationally through advertising campaigns and make the visa process simpler. They could also focus on developing niche tourism, like eco-tourism or cultural tourism, to attract specific types of visitors.

            <h3>Set 2: Study</h3>
            <h4>Part 1: Study</h4>
            <p>
                <b>1. Do you study or work?</b><br>
                - I'm a student. I'm currently in my final year of university.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>2. What subject are you studying?</b><br>
                - I'm studying Computer Science. I've always been fascinated by how technology works and I'm really enjoying the course.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>3. Why did you choose that subject?</b><br>
                - I chose it because I believe it's the future. There are so many career opportunities and I'm passionate about problem-solving and coding.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>4. Is it a popular subject in your country?</b><br>
                - Yes, it's very popular. The tech industry is booming here, so a lot of young people are choosing to study Computer Science or related fields.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>5. What do you hope to do after you finish your studies?</b><br>
                - I hope to get a job as a software developer. I'd love to work for a company that is developing innovative new technologies.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h4>Part 2: A Favorite Teacher</h4>
            <p>
                <b>Describe a teacher who has had a positive influence on you.</b><br>
                - I'd like to talk about my high school chemistry teacher, Mr. Jones. He taught me for two years. He wasn't just knowledgeable about chemistry; he had a fantastic way of making complex topics easy to understand. He was a very patient and kind person. He would always take extra time to help students who were struggling, never making us feel foolish for not getting something. He was passionate about his subject, and his enthusiasm was infectious. He saw potential in me even when I didn't see it myself and encouraged me to pursue science. He taught me that learning isn't just about memorizing facts, but about understanding concepts. He gave me the confidence to believe in my abilities, and because of him, I actually considered a career in science. He made a huge difference in my life, not just academically but also by showing me the importance of having a good attitude and a love for learning.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h4>Part 3: Education System</h4>
            <p>
                <b>1. What are the advantages of learning in a small class?</b><br>
                - A small class size allows for more individual attention from the teacher. It's easier to ask questions and get help. Students can also build better relationships with their peers, creating a more supportive learning environment.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>2. Should students be allowed to use mobile phones in class?</b><br>
                - I don't think they should be allowed. Phones can be a major distraction, both for the person using it and for others. It can disrupt the flow of the lesson. However, they could be used for specific educational purposes, like research, if the teacher manages it carefully.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>3. How has technology changed the way we learn today?</b><br>
                - Technology has fundamentally changed education. We now have access to an incredible amount of information online. We can take courses from anywhere in the world, and tools like educational apps and videos make learning more interactive and engaging. It has made learning more accessible and flexible.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>4. What role do you think teachers will have in the future?</b><br>
                - I think the role of teachers will shift from being the primary source of information to being facilitators and guides. With so much information available online, a teacher's job will be to help students navigate that information, think critically, and develop problem-solving skills.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>5. How important is it for children to learn a second language?</b><br>
                - It's very important. Learning a second language has cognitive benefits, like improving memory and problem-solving skills. It also opens up cultural opportunities, helping children to understand different societies and communicate with people from other countries.

            <h3>Set 3: Friends</h3>
            <h4>Part 1: Friends</h4>
            <p>
                <b>1. Do you have a lot of friends?</b><br>
                - I have a small group of very close friends, rather than a large circle of acquaintances.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>2. Who is your best friend?</b><br>
                - My best friend is a guy named Tom. We've known each other since we were kids, and we've been through a lot together.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>3. How do you usually spend time with your friends?</b><br>
                - We often go for hikes or just hang out at a cafe and talk. We also enjoy cooking together and having dinner parties.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>4. Do you prefer to have a few close friends or many friends?</b><br>
                - I definitely prefer having a few close friends. I value deep, meaningful connections over a large number of superficial ones. I think it's better to have a few people you can truly rely on.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>5. How is friendship different for children and adults?</b><br>
                - For children, friendships are often based on proximity and shared activities. They can make friends easily at school or in a park. For adults, friendships are more often based on shared values and life experiences. It can be harder for adults to make new friends because they have more responsibilities and less free time.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h4>Part 2: An Old Friend</h4>
            <p>
                <b>Describe a friend you have known for a long time.</b><br>
                - I'd like to talk about my friend, David. We met on the very first day of high school, sitting next to each other in class. We've been friends for about fifteen years now. We've always had a lot in common; we both love hiking, camping, and reading science fiction. We used to spend our weekends exploring the local parks and forests. Even though we live in different cities now, we still try to meet up a few times a year for a big hike, and we talk on the phone regularly. He is important to me because he is one of the most reliable and supportive people I know. He has always been there for me, celebrating my successes and helping me through tough times. He knows me better than almost anyone else, and I feel like I can be completely myself around him without any judgment. He's a true friend in every sense of the word.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h4>Part 3: Social Relationships</h4>
            <p>
                <b>1. How has social media affected friendships?</b><br>
                - Social media has changed friendships in a few ways. It makes it easier to stay in touch with people who live far away. However, it can also lead to a more superficial kind of connection, where people have hundreds of 'friends' but no real deep connections. It can also create a lot of social pressure.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>2. Is it easier to make friends now than it was in the past?</b><br>
                - I think it's both easier and harder. It's easier in the sense that social media and apps connect us with people from all over the world. But it's harder to form genuine, face-to-face friendships in the real world because people are often more isolated and distracted by their screens.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>3. How do people maintain long-distance friendships?</b><br>
                - People use a variety of methods. They use video calls, messaging apps, and social media to stay connected. I think the key is to make a conscious effort to regularly check in with each other, rather than just waiting for the other person to reach out. Making an effort to meet up in person whenever possible is also crucial.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>4. What are the qualities of a good friend?</b><br>
                - A good friend is loyal, trustworthy, and supportive. They should be a good listener and be able to give honest advice, even if it's not what you want to hear. A good friend should also be someone you can have fun with and who accepts you for who you are.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>5. Do you think it is possible for men and women to be just friends?</b><br>
                - Yes, absolutely. I think the idea that men and women can't be friends is a bit outdated. People's friendships are based on shared interests, trust, and mutual respect, and gender doesn't have to be a factor in that. I have several close friends who are the opposite gender, and our friendship is purely platonic.

            <h3>Set 4: Free Time</h3>

            <p>
                <b>1. What do you usually do in your free time?</b><br>
                - In my free time, I love to read books, especially fantasy and historical fiction. I also enjoy going for walks in the park to relax.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>2. Do you think it is important to have hobbies?</b><br>
                - Yes, I think it's very important. Hobbies give us a chance to de-stress, learn new skills, and connect with people who have similar interests. They add richness and balance to our lives.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>3. Have your hobbies changed since you were a child?</b><br>

                - I would love to learn how to play the piano. I've always been fascinated by the sound of the piano and the way people can create such beautiful music with it. I'd probably start by taking lessons from a private tutor, or maybe even use an online program. I would need a piano, of course, and a good instruction book to get started. The reason I want to start this hobby is that I've always wanted to be able to play a musical instrument, and the piano is my first choice. It would be a great creative outlet and a way to relax after a long day of work.

However, it has also blurred the lines between work and home, as people are now expected to be available 24/7 through emails and phones. This can make it hard to truly switch off and relax.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>4. What are the benefits of having a hobby?</b><br>

I would need to find a few good recipes for each of the dishes and I would have to make sure I had all the ingredients. I would also need to buy some authentic bento boxes to serve the food in. The reason I want to cook this is that I think my friends would really appreciate the effort. It's a very visually appealing meal and it's a way to introduce them to a new cuisine in a fun and authentic way. I've been wanting to try to make it myself for a while, and it would be a great way to show my friends how much I appreciate them.

            <h4>Part 2: An Event in Bad Weather</h4>
            <p>
                <b>Describe an occasion when you had to change your plans because of the weather.</b><br>
                - I remember a time when my friends and I had planned to go to the beach for a day of swimming and sunbathing. We had been looking forward to it for weeks, and we had packed everything we needed. But when we woke up that morning, it was raining heavily and there was a storm. We were all very disappointed, but we had to change our plans. Instead of going to the beach, we went to the cinema and watched a movie. It wasn't what we had planned, but we still had a good time. The reason I remember this occasion so well is that it was a good reminder that we can't control everything, and that we have to be flexible and adaptable.

            <p>
                <b>1. Do you like shopping?</b><br>
                - I don't love shopping, but I don't hate it either. I enjoy shopping for things that I need, but I don't like to spend a lot of time in malls.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>2. How often do you go shopping?</b><br>
                - I go shopping once or twice a month, usually to buy groceries and other necessities.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>3. What kinds of things do you usually buy?</b><br>
                - I usually buy groceries, clothes, and books. I also buy gifts for my friends and family.

            <p>
                <b>4. Do you prefer to shop online or in a physical store?</b><br>
                - I prefer to shop in a physical store. I like to be able to see and touch the products before I buy them. It's also more of a social experience.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>5. Do you think that shopping is a popular hobby?</b><br>
                - Yes, I think so. A lot of people love to go shopping in their free time. They see it as a form of entertainment and a way to relax.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h4>Part 2: A Shopping Experience</h4>
            <p>
                <b>Describe a time when you bought something special for someone else.</b><br>
                - I'd like to talk about the time I bought a gift for my mother's birthday. I wanted to get her something special, so I decided to make her a photo album with all of our favorite family photos. I spent hours looking through old photos and arranging them in the album. I also wrote some small captions for each photo. When I gave it to her, she was so happy that she cried. The reason it was so special is that it was a very personal and thoughtful gift. It wasn't something that I just bought from a store; it was something that I had made myself. It was a way to show her how much I love and appreciate her.
            </p>
            <br>

            <p>
                <b>1. How has online shopping changed the way we buy things?</b><br>
                - Online shopping has changed the way we buy things in a big way. We can now buy things from anywhere in the world, and we can get them delivered right to our door. It has made shopping more convenient and accessible.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>2. Do you think that consumerism is a problem in modern society?</b><br>

            <p>

            </p>
            <p>
                <b>4. Do you think that people should be encouraged to buy local products?</b><br>
                - Yes, I think so. Buying local products supports local businesses and helps to create jobs. It also reduces our carbon footprint, as local products don't have to be transported as far.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>5. How do you think shopping will change in the future?</b><br>
                - I think shopping will become even more digital. We will see more use of virtual reality and augmented reality in shopping. I also think we will see a lot more use of artificial intelligence to personalize our shopping experience.
