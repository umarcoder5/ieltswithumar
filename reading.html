        <div class="section-box">This test consists of three sections with 40 questions. There are three texts, which
            are
            taken from journals, books, magazines and newspapers. The texts are on topics of general interest. At least
            one
            text contains detailed logical argument. There are different types of questions, and we’re going to look at
            some
            of these. Before that, let’s think about the two most important reading techniques that you’ll need to use.
        </div>
        <h2>Skimming & Scanning</h2>
        <p>⯀<b>Skimming</b> means looking over a text very quickly in order to get the gist - in other words, a basic
            idea
            of what it’s about. You can do this by looking at the title of the passage, the subheadings (if there are
            any)
            and the first and last sentences of each paragraph. The first sentence of each paragraph is especially
            important
            as it tends to contain the main idea of that paragraph. Skimming the passage before you try to answer the
            questions is essential, as it gives you an idea of the topic and of how the passage is organised.</p>
        <p>⯀<b>Scanning</b> means looking through the text very quickly for a specific piece of information. This could
            be
            something like a name or date, or it could be an idea or statement, for example someone’s opinion. It could
            also
            be looking for key words or words with similar meanings, as we talked about above. When you’ve read the
            question
            and understood what you’re looking for, you’ll then need to scan the text to find the answer. (This will be
            easier if you’ve skimmed the text first!) Notice that neither scanning nor skimming involve reading the text
            word for word. Again, it’s important to remember that you’re not supposed to read every word.</p>
        <h2>Reading Question Types</h2>
        <p>⯀A variety of question types is used, including: multiple choice, identifying information (True/False/Not
            Given),
            identifying the writer's views/claims (Yes/No/Not Given), matching information, matching headings, matching
            features, matching sentence endings, sentence completion, summary completion, note completion, table
            completion,
            flow-chart completion, diagram label completion and short-answer questions.</p>
        <h3>Multiple Choice Questions</h3>
        <p>⯀IELTS Academic reading multiple choice questions have about 3-4 options from which we have to choose our
            answer.
            This might be in the form of a question&answer type or a choose a correct ending to a sentence type. These
            answers appear in chronological order according to the passage.</p>
        <h3>Match Questions</h3>
        <p>⯀There are various types of matching questions in IELTS academic reading tests and each one is different from
            another.</p>
        <h3>Matching Headings</h3>
        <p>⯀In this type of question, a list of headings will be given and you are asked to match these headings with a
            paragraph in the passage. You should read the headings before you begin reading the text. To get the correct
            answer, you have to read the complete paragraph and not just stop with the first few lines of the paragraph.
            There will also be many other headings that are not related to any of the paragraphs given in the passage,
            in
            such cases, try to identify those types of headings too.</p>
        <h3>Matching information</h3>
        <p>⯀Matching Information questions have a list which contains information taken from the paragraphs. You are
            asked
            to find out the paragraph from which the information is taken. Sometimes the question may be tricky because
            the
            information given might not be in exact words as given in the paragraph instead it will be paraphrased so
            you
            need to read the paragraph to understand the meaning/idea behind it to answer these questions.</p>
        <h3>Matching Features</h3>
        <p>⯀In this type of question, there will be a list of items in the box and you need to match these items by
            reading
            and understanding some sentences in the passages. The list may be of the name of people or cities. For
            example,
            If there is a name of a person in the box of items then the question may be to match the sentence with the
            person who said them. Like other types of match questions, some of the items mentioned may not be available
            in
            the passage. So, to save time read the passage before answering each question.</p>
        <h3>Matching sentence endings</h3>
        <p>⯀In this type of question, you need to connect two halves of the sentences. The first half of the sentence
            will
            be already given you need to find out which is the appropriate ending for the sentence from the list given.
            While choosing from the list you need to keep the following things in mind:</p>
        <p>⯀There should not be any grammatical errors in the sentence.</p>
        <p>⯀The ending sentence chosen by you should make sense.</p>
        <p>⯀The sentence should have the same meaning as the sentence in the passage.</p>
        <h3>True/False/Not given Questions</h3>
        <p>⯀Similar to the True/False/Not given questions, Yes/No/Not given questions also have various statements. But
            here
            you are asked to agree or disagree with the statement based on the opinion of the author.</p>
        <h3>Note, Table, Diagram and Summary Completion Questions</h3>
        <p>⯀In Note, Table, Summary and Diagram completion questions, you will be asked to complete a set of notes,
            tables,
            diagram or a summary based on the information given in the text. Sometimes the question will be to write a
            short
            answer and sometimes you’ll have to choose from the list of answers given. Usually, these kinds of questions
            will only be based on one part of the passage, so you won’t have to read the whole passage to fill the
            important
            information.</p>
        <h3>Sentence completion and Short-answer Questions</h3>
        <p>⯀IELTS academic reading Sentence completion and Short answer questions are almost similar. In sentence
            completion, you’ll be asked to fill in the blank spaces using the words given in the text. Whereas, in short
            answers, you’ll have to take words from the given text to write the short answers. It is important to pay
            close
            attention to the instructions that are given in the question because in some instructions there will be a
            word
            limit mentioned and you may lose marks if you don’t follow it.</p>

        <h2>The following guide will help you maximise your score</h2>
        <p>⯀A summary provides a short and clear description of content mentioned in a text or a speech. In IELTS
            Reading,
            there will be a summary that will re-tell the main ideas of a text. That summary will have gaps that must be
            filled using words from the passage or from a list of options.</p>
        <p>⯀Understanding the general meaning of the passage is a challenge to some candidates, and strong skimming and
            scanning skills are necessary for the completion of such task.</p>
        <h2>General notes for the IELTS Reading Test:</h2>
        <p>⯀Read the instructions carefully.</p>
        <p>⯀Read and paraphrase the passage title and questions (say what they mean in other words).</p>
        <p>⯀Skim the text – read it quickly to get the general idea.</p>
        <p>⯀Scan the text – read it quickly to find specific information to answer the question.</p>
        <p>⯀Underline or circle any words, dates or names that stand out.</p>
        <p>⯀Use your time effectively – approximately 20 minutes on each passage (reading, answering questions,
            transferring
            answers to the answer sheet in the paper test).</p>
        <h2>Useful Tips:</h2>
        <p>⯀Ensure that you read and understand the instructions. If the instructions say you must choose an answer from
            a
            list of options, you must use that list. The answers will be preceded by letters, for example A-G, and you
            may
            only use those letters as your answers. If you write the word instead of the letter, your answer will be
            marked
            as incorrect, and you will not gain a point even if your answer is correct.</p>
        <p>⯀If the instructions state that you must use words from the passage, they will inform you of how many words
            you
            are allowed to use, such as: 'you may use no more than 2 words from the passage'. In this case, you will
            therefore only be allowed to use 1 or 2 words from the text as your answer for each gap. If you use more
            than
            the number indicated in the instructions, your answer will be counted as incorrect, even if it contains the
            correct answer.</p>
        <p>⯀If the instructions tell you to use words from the passage, make sure you only use words taken directly from
            the
            passage. You may not paraphrase or use your own words to fill in the gaps, or those will be considered
            incorrect, even if the meaning is correct.</p>
        <p>⯀Because this question requires you to understand general meaning, make sure that you pay attention to all
            the
            information provided, including the title, which should give you an idea of what the text is going to be
            about.
        </p>
        <p>⯀Skim the summary first. Read them quickly to get a basic understanding of their content. Then, read them
            again
            in more detail to understand the kind of information and language you need to identify in the passage.</p>
        <p>⯀Paraphrasing is the key to completing this task effectively and efficiently. Identify the key language in
            the
            title and in the summary, and paraphrase that key language (say what it means in other words). The summary
            will
            not always contain the same words as in the text, as it will be re-explaining what the text says. Therefore,
            paraphrasing key words and phrases in the question and title may provide you with words that are actually
            located in the text. Use your scanning skills to search for those paraphrases in the text, and once you have
            identified them, read around them to locate the language you need to use as your answer.</p>
        <p>⯀Some key information you will be able to paraphrase, such as verbs (e.g.: 'cry' could also be 'weep' of
            'whine'), but other key information may include names or dates that cannot be paraphrased, although will be
            easier to identify in the text.</p>
        <p>⯀Pay attention to the grammar around the gaps in the questions. The grammar being used will be a good
            indicator
            of the type of language you will need to choose as your answer (verb, noun, adjective, etc). For instance,
            if
            the gap is preceded by 'want to', it is safe to assume the necessary language to fill in the gap will be a
            verb.
            Analyse the grammar to predict the type of missing language. If you need to choose an answer from a list of
            options, make sure that it makes grammatical sense.</p>
        <p>⯀Answers usually come in order, which will be helpful in locating the information and answers more
            efficiently.
        </p>
        <p>⯀Be very mindful of time – spend 1 or 2 minutes skimming the text, and do not try to understand every single
            word. The goal is to gain a general understating of the text. Detailed reading only comes in when you have
            scanned and located key information in the text that will help you decide on your answer for the gap. To
            help
            with time-management, read the first and last sentences of the text, and the first sentence of each
            paragraph
            will normally describe the theme of the paragraphs.</p>
        <h2>Pay attention to the helpful notes below:</h2>
        <p>⯀Instructions that inform you of your word limit can be confusing. Here is a detailed explanation on how to
            interpret them; for example:
            Write <b>NO MORE THAN TWO WORDS AND/OR A NUMBER</b>
            This means that you can use:
            (1 word OR 2 words OR 1 number) OR (1 word + 1 number) OR (2 words + 1 number)</p>
        <p>⯀If a number is expressed in letter form and contains more than one word (e.g: 'forty-six'), it still counts
            as
            one word. In this case: 'forty-six years old' has 4 words, but 'forty-six' is considered a single word, so
            'forty-six years old' equals 1 number + 2 words.</p>
        <p>⯀Words that use hyphens (-) such 'cold-blooded' or 'fun-loving' count as one word.</p>
        <p>⯀If you find key words in the questions that are easily identifiable in the text or which you have previously
            found through skimming the text, answer those questions first, but ensure that you study those parts of the
            text
            carefully before deciding on an answer.</p>
        <p>⯀Do not rush your answers. If you need to choose answers from a list, several options may seem grammatically
            correct and/or content-appropriate for one gap. It is crucial that you focus on the meaning of the sentence
            surrounding the gap, so that you can choose the most suitable option.</p>
