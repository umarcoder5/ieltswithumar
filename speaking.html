        <h2>IELTS Speaking Test</h2>
        <div class="section-box">The IELTS Speaking
            Test
            is the final part of the exam. Your test will usually be at some time between 1.30pm and 5.00pm. You can
            take
            only your ID document into the exam room.</div>
        <div class="section-box">The test lasts
            between
            11 and 14 minutes. You will be interviewed by an examiner who will record your conversation. Timing is
            strictly
            controlled by the examiner, so do not be surprised if he or she interrupts you during an answer.</div>
        <h2>There are 3 parts in the Speaking Test:</h2>
        <div class="section-box">Introduction/ interview: around 10 questions in 4 to 5 minutes.</div>
        <div class="section-box">Short presentation: talk for 2 minutes with 1 minute to prepare.</div>
        <div class="section-box">Discussion: around 5 questions in 4 to 5 minutes.</div>
        <p>Preparation is the key to a good score in IELTS Speaking. Different skills are tested in each part, so you
            need
            to know exactly what to do.</p>
        <p>We can predict the kinds of questions that the examiner will ask. We will prepare ideas, possible answers and
            good vocabulary for each part of the test.</p>
        <h2>Which part is the most important?</h2>
        <p>⯀Do the 3 parts of the speaking test carry equal weighting when your score is calculated, or is one part more
            important?</p>
        <p>⯀The simple answer is that the 3 parts are not scored separately; the examiner rates the student's
            performance as
            a whole. In this sense, neither part is more important. However, it's useful to think about the 3 parts like
            this:</p>
        <p>⯀Part 1 is supposed to be quite easy (like a warm-up), so you won't get a high score if you only do well in
            this
            part.</p>
        <p>⯀Part 2 is when the examiner really gets a chance to assess how good you are. He/she will now have an idea of
            what scores to give you.</p>
        <p>⯀During part 3, the examiner is making his/her final decision. A good performance here can boost your score.
        </p>
        <h2>If you don’t understand, …</h2>
        <p>⯀What should you do if you don't understand a question in the speaking test? Here are some tips:</p>
        <p>⯀In part 1, the examiner is not allowed to help you, but he/she can repeat the question. Just say: "Sorry,
            can
            you repeat the question please?" If you still don't understand the second time, try to say something related
            to
            the topic or any of the words that you heard. Try your best, then focus on the next question.</p>
        <p>⯀In part 2, you are given a task card with the question written on it, so you shouldn't have any problems in
            this
            part. If there is a word that you don't understand on the task card, don't ask the examiner - he/she is not
            allowed to help.</p>
        <p>⯀In part 3, the examiner is allowed to rephrase the question. If you don't understand, just say something
            like:
            "Sorry, can you explain that question in a different way please?"</p>
        <h2>Speaking Tips</h2>
        <p>Many people agree that the secret of success in the Speaking test is being confident and creative person.
            Does it
            mean that others will fail? Not at all! This test is PREDICTABLE. Use the following tips to prepare yourself
            to
            what’s coming and the confidence will come.</p>
        <h2>What are the examiners looking for?</h2>
        <p>If you know what is important to IELTS examiners, it improves your chances of success. These guidelines refer
            to
            every part of the Speaking test. Stick to them and you will satisfy your examiner.</p>
        <p>⯀Understand what the examiner asks you and confirm that by answering accordingly.</p>
        <p>⯀Speak without long pauses (when you are trying to think of something to say)</p>
        <p>⯀Demonstrate how many "smart" words you know.</p>
        <p>⯀Use all the tenses when you speak - past, present, future – and use them correctly.</p>
        <p>⯀Pronounce the words correctly.</p>
        <p>⯀Important! Accent has nothing to do with pronunciation, so it will not affect your score.</p>
        <h2>Keep it simple!</h2>
        <p>⯀This tip refers to the whole Speaking test. Don’t start long and complicated sentences if you don’t know how
            to
            finish them! Keep your sentences simple, and words - understandable. If you make grammatical error – it’s ok
            to
            correct yourself, but don’t overdo it, you must sound fluent.</p>
        <p>⯀When you hear a question, your mind automatically draws an image with the answer. You can describe this
            image in
            your own language, but when you start to describe it in English, suddenly you don’t have enough words in
            your
            vocabulary. So try to think of what part of that image you can describe, do it and stop there. Don’t let
            yourself show what words you don’t know by saying incomplete sentences.</p>
        <h2>Ask Questions to the Examiner:</h2>
        <p>⯀If you don’t understand the question, there is nothing wrong in asking the examiner to repeat. If you have
            any
            confusion regarding the question asked, you can clarify it by asking the examiner to repeat. You will not
            lose
            marks for asking doubts.</p>
        <h2>Bring Emotions in your Speech:</h2>
        <p>⯀While taking the speaking test, choose the words carefully. Bring in emotions, wherever necessary. Try to be
            like a native English speaker.</p>
        <h2>Extend your Speech:</h2>
        <p>⯀If the examiner asks you to speak about some topic, do not finish it in one sentence. Try to talk about the
            topic completely.</p>
        <h2>Do not panic if a mistake happens:</h2>
        <p>⯀If you make a mistake while speaking, do not get scared. Instead, try to correct the mistake. There will be
            no
            deduction of marks if your thought process is good.</p>
        <h2>Keep a separate time to think for an answer:</h2>
        <p>⯀Listen to the question carefully. If you do not understand the question or if you are unsure about the
            answer,
            admit frankly to the examiner so that he gives another topic. Or ask for some extra time to think about the
            answer. The examiner may not refuse to give you the extra time.</p>
        <h2>Do not learn the answers by heart:</h2>
        <p>⯀When you are practicing for the speaking test, do not memorize the answers. Try to make an innovative and
            impressive content on your own. From the way you talk, the examiner can easily find out if you are
            spontaneous
            or not.</p>
        <h2>Focus on what is important:</h2>
        <p>⯀You can try to improve your vocabulary by practicing. Identify the common mistakes you make and try to
            rectify
            them.</p>
        <h2>Stick on to the topic:</h2>
        <p>⯀It is very important to be explanatory but do not divert from the topic. Stick to the topic and speak for
            it.
            Deviating from the topic will give a bad impression to the examiner.</p>
