        <div class="section-box">You must write an essay of at least 150 words.</div>
        <p>You are given a visual presentation which can be in form of a graph, diagram, bar
            chart, table, map or a process. You must write an essay explaining the main features of the figure and make
            comparisons where relevant. You must not include any personal opinion while you are explaining the figure.
            You just need to describe and report what you are given.</p>

            <h3>How to use your 20 minutes:</h3>
            <ul class="styled-list">
                <li>You have 20 minutes for Task 1, so try spending 5 minutes on each paragraph. This might help you to organise
                    your time better.</li>
                <li>First 5 minutes: Read the question, make sure you understand the chart, write your introduction by paraphrasing the question.</li>
                <li>Second 5 minutes: Look at the chart and try to find 2 general points. Don't look at specific details; look for "the big picture". Write 2 sentences summarising the information.</li>
                <li>Final 10 minutes: Describe specific details. Try to break this part into 2 paragraphs because it looks better. You could spend 5 minutes on each paragraph.</li>

            <ul class="styled-list">
                <li>The IELTS writing Task 1 academic is an information transfer task which requires you to write a fairly
                    precise account of some information presented in graphic form such as a graph, table or some form of
                    pictorial representation of data. In order to complete the task successfully, follow these suggestions.</li>
                <li>Introduction should describe the purpose of the report and say what the overall trends are. For example, if
                    the graph is climbing up or dropping down, you should mention the change or the changes accurately and
                    meaningfully. You need to remember that you are describing a graph to someone who does not see it, so your
                    words must draw the picture. Write what the graph is about, its dates and location as well as the right kind
                    of measurements used. You must write in complete sentences.</li>
                <li>Do not copy whole sentences or long phrases from the question. The examiner will recognize them, and they
                    will not count towards the minimum number of words you must write.</li>
                <li>The overall trend or the general over view should sum up the global or the general trends shown in the
                    figure and compare them if possible. Your personal opinion should not appear anywhere in the report. You
                    should not include other information that does not appear in the figure or the chart since this kind of
                    writing can and will probably be penalized.</li>
                <li>The body paragraphs should describe the most important features and trends, while all the information is
                    summarized to avoid unnecessary details. When you are given too much information, you need to group them and
                    select the most noticeable ones. For example, if there is a graph that has 2 peaks, you should mention them
                    and tell when those peaks appeared and what the peak values are; however, if there are 5 similar trends, you
                    need to group the information in order to avoid over length writing, which can lead to a waste of time.</li>
                <li>Notice how many distinctive features the diagram or the graph has and divide them into paragraphs, one
                    paragraph one set of features that is a group of similar trends. You should also link the paragraphs by
                    sentences that logically connect them to one another.</li>
                <li>You need to write about all the periods of time and all the subjects of the graph or the figure. If it shows
                    several years for example 1992, 1993, 1994 and 1995, write about all of them. If it is about men and women,
                    write about both genders. Remember that summarizing does not mean throwing away information. The key here is
                    to select what is important, organize it and make comparisons, which is describing both the similarities and
                    the differences where relevant.</li>
                <li>You may make notes on the virtual scratchpad in the computer-delivered test or on the question sheet if you are doing the paper-based test. The examiner will not see your notes.</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>In IELTS Writing Task 2:</h2>
        <div class="section-box">You have about 40 minutes.</div>
        <div class="section-box">You must write an essay of at least 250 words.</div>
        <p>You are writing for an educated non-specialist audience and not a university lecturer.
            Therefore, your language does not need to be that formal. You are, in most cases, expected to give your opinion. You may also have to include your life experience and some relevant examples. You must either argue, that is, you must present an opinion and give reasons to support your opinions or express the causes or consequences of a situation. Sometimes you should either predict what might happen in the future or give solutions to a problem. You must organize your writing in a good standard manner and you must use appropriate language and ideas.</p>

        <h2>IELTS Writing Academic Task 1 - Task 2:</h2>
        <div class="list-container">
            <ul class="styled-list">
                <li>In order to get a good vocabulary score, you should try to show knowledge of a range of words, a broad
                    vocabulary. So, if possible, use suitable synonyms and other words sometimes instead of repeating the same
                    word all the time.</li>
                <li>As well as that, it sometimes does not "sound" very good or, is not very good style to repeat the same key
                    word twice in the same sentence or very close to each other, such as near the beginning of the next
                    sentence. In this case, you can often use a pronoun such as "it", "them", "this", "that" or a phrase such as
                    "this situation" etc.</li>
                <li>But the idea that you should not repeat the same word more than twice is too rigid and, in fact, ridiculous
                    in a 250 word essay. Just try not to repeat it many times, if possible, especially repeating them close
                    together. But there are some words that don't have many synonyms or other ways to write them so, in this
                    case, you might have to repeat the word a bit more often than with other words.</li>
                <li>The problem with lower-level students is that they are sometimes not very sure of what are suitable synonyms
                    or alternative ways to express a word. They then choose words that are close to but not the same in meaning,
                    or words that change the emphasis of the original word, or words that are completely unsuitable for other
                    reasons. This will hurt the vocabulary score, not help it, and it might confuse the reader, making the essay
                    difficult to understand. The candidate in this case would get a better score by repeating the same word a
                    bit more and not making unsuitable substitutions for that word.</li>
                <li>It is not true that "examiners prefer more than 300 words". You get graded on the criteria that are written
                    in the Task 2 Band Descriptor and according to how well you follow the instructions in the essay question.
                    "More than 300 words" is not written in the Band Descriptor nor in the instructions for the essay.</li>
                <li>Certainly, you should write more than 250 words. To be safe, you should aim for at least 255 or
                    260 words.</li>
                <li>It is true that, in general, you can express more ideas or points in 300 words than in 260 words and, if you
                    successfully did that, you would probably get a better score. We say "probably", not "certainly" and we
                    emphasize "successfully" because forcing yourself to write more than 300 words might add to the total number
                    of errors you make in grammar and vocabulary, all for the sake of writing only a few weak extra ideas, or
                    completely irrelevant ideas, not ideas or points that have real value in answering the essay question.</li>
                <li>So, it is clear that writing more than 300 words does not automatically give you a better score and, in
                    fact, trying to write more than 300 words in the real test creates several problems. The biggest problem for
                    people at the Band 5 to 6 level is that it is difficult to write a good essay of 300 or more words in about
                    40 minutes. Someone at the Band 8 level could do it but a Band 5.5 candidate would be writing in a hurry,
                    not thinking very clearly about the real or full meaning of the question, not thinking very clearly about
                    the logic and arrangement of the ideas, and writing sentences quickly without thinking very much if the
                    grammar and vocabulary is as good as he or she can write. And, as we mentioned above, some people who try to
                    write more than 300 words might have already run out of relevant ideas or points and they end up writing
                    irrelevant content (or weak ideas) that might actually damage their score, even if there are no extra
                    grammar or vocabulary errors.</li>
                <li>While handwriting quality is not a factor in the computer-delivered test, the principle of not rushing is still crucial. Writing in a hurry, whether on paper or on a keyboard, increases the risk of making careless errors and producing disorganized, incoherent text. The key is to manage your time effectively to write a well-structured and accurate response.</li>
                <li>Overall, we think candidates at the Band 4.5 to 7 level should teach themselves to write Task 2 essays that
                    are between 260 and 290 words long. (Writing 260 to 275 words would be better.) In the computer-delivered test, the word count is automatically displayed, so you can easily track your progress.</li>
                <li>One way to avoid wasting words on irrelevant content is to not use unnecessary words, or write unnecessary
                    content, in your introduction paragraph. Certainly, don't repeat the question, even if you rewrite the
                    question using different words to the original wording. (You will lose some of your word count if you just
                    repeat the question almost verbatim and if you go below 250 for your word count, you lose points.) And don't
                    explain the meaning of the question as if the reader is an uneducated person who doesn't understand what the
                    question means.
                    Instead, try to write a concise and relevant piece of extra information about the topic or the question, a
                    piece of information that is related to the remainder of your essay. (This is what "introduction" really
                    means.) But simply writing that "this question has recently aroused a lot of controversy in society" (or
                    words to that effect) is weak and boring, (weak because every Task 2 question is about a social question
                    that has two or more viewpoints), is often untrue or inaccurate (for example, by writing "a lot" or
                    "recently" when the topic may not really be discussed very much or when it has actually been a social
                    question for a long time), and is obviously from some kind of "essay template".
                    As a result of the non-originality of this statement (since it came from a template) and the inaccuracies,
                    it usually fails to impress the examiner. The people who write those "templates" suggest writing about how
                    the topic has recently become controversial for the students who lack the ability to write anything else.
                    It's better than nothing because it does, more or less, apply to any Task 2 writing question, but try to do
                    better than that if you hope to get 6.5 or higher.</li>

            <h2>IELTS Writing: Do's and Don't's</h2>
            <ul class="styled-list">
                <li><strong>Using contractions:</strong> For example "I don't think" or "We can't say." Never use contractions in academic writing.</li>
                <li><strong>Writing too few words:</strong> If you write much less than the required word count, the examiner has to reduce your score, even if your essay is good quality. On the computer-delivered test, the word count is visible, so you should keep an eye on it to ensure you meet the minimum requirement.</li>
                <li><strong>Writing too many words:</strong> Writing excessively long essays can lead to errors and may cause you to run out of time. Aim for a maximum of about 350 words in Task 2 to ensure you have enough time for planning, writing, and reviewing.</li>
                <li><strong>Using informal words:</strong> For example "a nice idea" or "a silly thing to do" instead of academic words (for example "a positive idea" or "a regrettable thing to do.") Remember that academic vocabulary is different from the language you would use in English when talking to friends.</li>
                <li><strong>Giving personal opinion in an IDEAS type Task:</strong> Check if the Task is asking for your opinion or not. The first question you should ask yourself is "Is this an OPINION or an IDEAS Task?"</li>
                <li><strong>Telling stories about your personal history, friends or family:</strong> The Task tells you to use "examples from your own experience," but this does not mean describing stories from your life or people you know! It means describing examples of things in the world that you know about, have studied or have learned about in the media.</li>
                <li><strong>Giving evidence which is too detailed or specific to a subject:</strong> You may be an expert in a particular social or scientific field, but the examiner probably has a different specialty. You need to make your ideas and examples accessible to a general reader. For example, if the Task topic is about money and you are an accountant, do not use specialized accounting terms.</li>
                <li><strong>Being emotional or too dramatic when giving your opinion in an OPINION Task:</strong> You may feel strongly about issues such as animals or crime, but academic writing must be unemotional. So avoid phrases such as "a disgusting idea" or "I detest this concept." It is much better to say "an unacceptable idea" or "I disapprove of this concept," which is more impersonal and academic; similar to the type of writing that people use in business reports or university essays.</li>
