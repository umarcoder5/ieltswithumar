        <h1>Writing Overview, Tips & Common Mistakes</h1>
        <h2>In IELTS Writing Task 1:</h2>
        <div class="section-box">You have about 20 minutes.</div>
        <div class="section-box">You must write an essay of at least 150 words.</div>
        <div class="section-box">You are given a visual presentation which can be in form of a graph, diagram, bar
            chart, table, map or a process. You must write an essay explaining the main features of the figure and make
            comparisons where relevant. You must not include any personal opinion while you are explaining the figure.
            You just need to describe and report what you are given.</div>
        <h2>How to use your 20 minutes:</h2>
        <p>⯀You have 20 minutes for Task 1, so try spending 5 minutes on each paragraph. This might help you to organise
            your time better. First 5 minutes: Read the question, make sure you understand the chart, write your
            introduction by paraphrasing the question. Second 5 minutes: Look at the chart and try to find 2 general
            points. Don't look at specific details; look for "the big picture". Write 2 sentences summarising the
            information. Final 10 minutes: Describe specific details. Try to break this part into 2 paragraphs because
            it looks better. You could spend 5 minutes on each paragraph.</p>
        <h2>Points to Apply in Task 1:</h2>
        <p>⯀The IELTS writing Task 1 academic is an information transfer task which requires you to write a fairly
            precise account of some information presented in graphic form such as a graph, table or some form of
            pictorial representation of data. In order to complete the task successfully, follow these suggestions.</p>
        <p>⯀Introduction should describe the purpose of the report and say what the overall trends are. For example, if
            the graph is climbing up or dropping down, you should mention the change or the changes accurately and
            meaningfully. You need to remember that you are describing a graph to someone who does not see it, so your
            words must draw the picture. Write what the graph is about, its dates and location as well as the right kind
            of measurements used. You must write in complete sentences. Notes are not acceptable.</p>
        <p>⯀Do not copy whole sentences or long phrases from the question. The examiner will recognize them, and they
            will not count towards the minimum number of words you must write.</p>
        <p>⯀The overall trend or the general over view should sum up the global or the general trends shown in the
            figure and compare them if possible. Your personal opinion should not appear anywhere in the report. You
            should not include other information that does not appear in the figure or the chart since this kind of
            writing can and will probably be penalized.</p>
        <p>⯀The body paragraphs should describe the most important features and trends, while all the information is
            summarized to avoid unnecessary details. When you are given too much information, you need to group them and
            select the most noticeable ones. For example, if there is a graph that has 2 peaks, you should mention them
            and tell when those peaks appeared and what the peak values are; however, if there are 5 similar trends, you
            need to group the information in order to avoid over length writing, which can lead to a waste of time.</p>
        <p>⯀Notice how many distinctive features the diagram or the graph has and divide them into paragraphs, one
            paragraph one set of features that is a group of similar trends. You should also link the paragraphs by
            sentences that logically connect them to one another.</p>
        <p>⯀You need to write about all the periods of time and all the subjects of the graph or the figure. If it shows
            several years for example 1992, 1993, 1994 and 1995, write about all of them. If it is about men and women,
            write about both genders. Remember that summarizing does not mean throwing away information. The key here is
            to select what is important, organize it and make comparisons, which is describing both the similarities and
            the differences where relevant.</p>
        <p>⯀You may write your plans on the question sheet if, for example, you want to underline key words or to write
            notes and make comparisons. The examiner who marks your writing will not see the question sheet.</p>
        <h2>In IELTS Writing Task 2:</h2>
        <div class="section-box">You have about 40 minutes.</div>
        <div class="section-box">You must write an essay of at least 250 words.</div>
        <div class="section-box">You are writing for an educated non-specialist audience and not a university lecturer.
            Therefore, your language does not need to be that formal.</div>
        <div class="section-box">You are, in most cases, expected to give your opinion. You may also have to include
            your life experience and
            some relevant examples.</div>
        <div class="section-box">You must either argue, that is, you must present an opinion and give reasons to support
            your opinions or
            express the causes or consequences of a situation. Sometimes you should either predict what might happen in
            the future or give solutions to a problem.</div>
        <div class="section-box">You must organize your writing in a good standard manner and you must use appropriate
            language and ideas.</div>
        <h2>Points to Apply in Task 2, Essay Writing:</h2>
        <p>⯀The topics of the questions will be of general interest, and no specialist knowledge is required. For
            example, topics can include travel, accommodation, current affairs, shops and services, health and welfare,
            health and safety, recreation, social and physical environment.</p>
        <p>⯀You must write in complete sentences. Notes are not acceptable.</p>
        <p>⯀Do not copy whole sentences or long phrases from the question. The examiner will recognize them, and they
            will not count towards the minimum number of words you must write.</p>
        <p>⯀You may write on the question sheet if, for example, you want to underline key words or to write notes. The
            examiner who marks your writing will not see the question sheet.</p>
        <h2>IELTS Writing Academic Task 1 - Task 2:</h2>
        <p>⯀In order to get a good vocabulary score, you should try to show knowledge of a range of words, a broad
            vocabulary. So, if possible, use suitable synonyms and other words sometimes instead of repeating the same
            word all the time.</p>
        <p>⯀As well as that, it sometimes does not "sound" very good or, is not very good style to repeat the same key
            word twice in the same sentence or very close to each other, such as near the beginning of the next
            sentence. In this case, you can often use a pronoun such as "it", "them", "this", "that" or a phrase such as
            "this situation" etc.</p>
        <p>⯀But the idea that you should not repeat the same word more than twice is too rigid and, in fact, ridiculous
            in a 250 word essay. Just try not to repeat it many times, if possible, especially repeating them close
            together. But there are some words that don't have many synonyms or other ways to write them so, in this
            case, you might have to repeat the word a bit more often than with other words.</p>
        <p>⯀The problem with lower-level students is that they are sometimes not very sure of what are suitable synonyms
            or alternative ways to express a word. They then choose words that are close to but not the same in meaning,
            or words that change the emphasis of the original word, or words that are completely unsuitable for other
            reasons. This will hurt the vocabulary score, not help it, and it might confuse the reader, making the essay
            difficult to understand. The candidate in this case would get a better score by repeating the same word a
            bit more and not making unsuitable substitutions for that word.</p>
        <p>⯀It is not true that "examiners prefer more than 300 words". You get graded on the criteria that are written
            in the Task 2 Band Descriptor and according to how well you follow the instructions in the essay question.
            "More than 300 words" is not written in the Band Descriptor nor in the instructions for the essay.</p>
        <p>⯀Certainly, you should write more than 250 words. Some examiners might use different methods to count a word,
            compared to you, (such as calling "90%" one word, not two) so, to be safe, you should write at least 255 or
            260 words.</p>
        <p>⯀It is true that, in general, you can express more ideas or points in 300 words than in 260 words and, if you
            successfully did that, you would probably get a better score. We say "probably", not "certainly" and we
            emphasize "successfully" because forcing yourself to write more than 300 words might add to the total number
            of errors you make in grammar and vocabulary, all for the sake of writing only a few weak extra ideas, or
            completely irrelevant ideas, not ideas or points that have real value in answering the essay question.</p>
        <p>⯀So, it is clear that writing more than 300 words does not automatically give you a better score and, in
            fact, trying to write more than 300 words in the real test creates several problems. The biggest problem for
            people at the Band 5 to 6 level is that it is difficult to write a good essay of 300 or more words in about
            40 minutes. Someone at the Band 8 level could do it but a Band 5.5 candidate would be writing in a hurry,
            not thinking very clearly about the real or full meaning of the question, not thinking very clearly about
            the logic and arrangement of the ideas, and writing sentences quickly without thinking very much if the
            grammar and vocabulary is as good as he or she can write. And, as we mentioned above, some people who try to
            write more than 300 words might have already run out of relevant ideas or points and they end up writing
            irrelevant content (or weak ideas) that might actually damage their score, even if there are no extra
            grammar or vocabulary errors.</p>
        <p>⯀In IELTS pen and paper based test, the quality of the handwriting (the legibility) might become poor when
            you write in a hurry. If it is too hard for the examiner to read, he or she might not bother to, (or might
            not be able to) closely read what you wrote or fully consider your ideas. You need to understand that
            examiners are grading a lot of papers at one time and they usually can't give a Task 2 essay more time than,
            say, 10 to 15 minutes because of the number of papers to do. Not only that, the examiner might be getting
            tired after grading many papers. I think that sometimes (not always) the legibility of the essay alone might
            be indirectly worth 1/4 of a band point for that essay due to the effect of poor legibility, even though
            this is not written in the Band Descriptor.</p>
        <p>⯀Overall, we think candidates at the Band 4.5 to 7 level should teach themselves to write Task 2 essays that
            are between 260 and 290 words long. (Writing 260 to 275 words would be better.) You can teach yourself this
            by practicing writing essays using copies of the real exam writing paper and then you can get to know how
            many lines you need to write to reach the word count you want.</p>
        <p>⯀One way to avoid wasting words on irrelevant content is to not use unnecessary words, or write unnecessary
            content, in your introduction paragraph. Certainly, don't repeat the question, even if you rewrite the
            question using different words to the original wording. (You will lose some of your word count if you just
            repeat the question almost verbatim and if you go below 250 for your word count, you lose points.) And don't
            explain the meaning of the question as if the reader is an uneducated person who doesn't understand what the
            question means.
            Instead, try to write a concise and relevant piece of extra information about the topic or the question, a
            piece of information that is related to the remainder of your essay. (This is what "introduction" really
            means.) But simply writing that "this question has recently aroused a lot of controversy in society" (or
            words to that effect) is weak and boring, (weak because every Task 2 question is about a social question
            that has two or more viewpoints), is often untrue or inaccurate (for example, by writing "a lot" or
            "recently" when the topic may not really be discussed very much or when it has actually been a social
            question for a long time), and is obviously from some kind of "essay template".
            As a result of the non-originality of this statement (since it came from a template) and the inaccuracies,
            it usually fails to impress the examiner. The people who write those "templates" suggest writing about how
            the topic has recently become controversial for the students who lack the ability to write anything else.
            It's better than nothing because it does, more or less, apply to any Task 2 writing question, but try to do
            better than that if you hope to get 6.5 or higher.</p>
        <h2>IELTS Writing: Do's and Don't's</h2>
        <p>⯀Using contractions (for example "I don't think" or "We can't say" ) instead of the full form ("I do not
            think" or "we cannot say.") Never use contractions in academic writing.</p>
        <p>⯀Writing too few words. If you write much less than the required word count, the examiner has to reduce your
            score, even if your essay is good quality. You should count the number of words in your essay after each
            paragraph and keep a continuous total; this way, you can be sure of reaching at least 250 words in 40
            minutes in Academic Task 2 writing.</p>
        <p>⯀Writing too many words. The examiner is paid to mark on an "essay per hour basis," and so will not read the
            end of an essay if it exceeds the minimum word count by more than about 100 words. This means he or she will
            not see the end of your argument, and your score will reduce considerably. Remember: 250 words minimum, and
            about 350 words maximum in Academic Task 2 writing.</p>
        <p>⯀Having handwriting that is difficult to read. IELTS is still a handwritten exam, and the examiners will not
            spend time trying to understand your writing. You must make sure that your handwriting can be read quickly.
            You should focus on writing clearly when you do your practice essays.</p>
        <p>⯀Using informal words (for example "a nice idea" or "a silly thing to do") instead of academic words (for
            example "a positive idea" or "a regrettable thing to do.") Remember that academic vocabulary is different
            from the language you would use in English when talking to friends.</p>
        <p>⯀Giving personal opinion in an IDEAS type Task. Check if the Task is asking for your opinion or not. The
            first question you should ask yourself is "Is this an OPINION or an IDEAS Task?"</p>
        <p>⯀Telling stories about your personal history, friends or family. The Task tells you to use "examples from
            your own experience," but this does not mean describing stories from your life or people you know! It means
            describing examples of things in the world that you know about, have studied or have learned about in the
            media.</p>
        <p>⯀Giving evidence which is too detailed or specific to a subject. You may be an expert in a particular social
            or scientific field, but the examiner probably has a different specialty. You need to make your ideas and
            examples accessible to a general reader. For example, if the Task topic is about money and you are an
            accountant, do not use specialized accounting terms.</p>
        <p>⯀Being emotional or too dramatic when giving your opinion in an OPINION Task. You may feel strongly about
            issues such as animals or crime, but academic writing must be unemotional. So avoid phrases such as "a
            disgusting idea" or "I detest this concept." It is much better to say "an unacceptable idea" or "I
            disapprove of this concept," which is more impersonal and academic; similar to the type of writing that
